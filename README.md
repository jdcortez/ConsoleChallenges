# ConsoleChallenges

This assignment from 1150 academy was given to practice C# fundamentals and implement the Repository pattern via console app challenges.  
The requirements can be found at https://elevenfifty.instructure.com/courses/363/assignments/5637

My project included the first three challenges.  The naming conventions of assemblies were ConsoleChallenge.ChallengeNumber.[UI,Repository,UnitTests]
All three projects referenced the Challenges.[Interfaces,Console]

Unit Tests were performed on all Repository assemblies.
